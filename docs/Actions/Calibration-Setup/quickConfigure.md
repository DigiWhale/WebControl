### Description
This 'guide' is designed to assist the user with initially configuring WebControl with specific parameters to allow for the calibration process to be successfully completed.

### Process

In order to successfully complete the calibration process, WebControl needs to know a few specific parameters so that when the calibration pattern can be cut successfully.  These values are specific to the design of the Maslow the user has opted to build:

* Kinematics Kit Type
* Chain Around Sprocket Type
* Distance Between Motors
* Height of Motors Above Workspace

The 'Quick Configure' function guides the user as to how to determine and enter the required information to set these parameters.
