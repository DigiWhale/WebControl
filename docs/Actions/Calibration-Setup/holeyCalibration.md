Make and record your measurements as requested.  Double check and triple check them.. seriously.. do it.

![Enter Measurements](../assets/holeyCalibration/measurements.png)


### Step 3: Enter Measurements

Enter the measurements and double and triple check you entered them correctly and in the correct units.  If so, press 'Calculate'

### Step 5: Dance a Jig

You're calibrated!  Note, calibration can be an iterative process and some have found improvements in their Maslow's accuracy by calibrating a second time.  Make sure to recut the test pattern if you chose to calibrate again.
